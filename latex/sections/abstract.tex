\begin{abstract}

This papers aims to provide an understandable survey of the stability mechanisms that a new breed of cryptocurrencies, called stablecoins, use to lower the price volatility seen in early cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. We deliberately avoid analyzing the specifics of any one project or brand of stablecoin---this space is in flux and our analysis is likely to stale quickly---and instead focus on foundational stability mechanisms which will be constant over time. Thus, we distil the stability mechanisms from a broad set of stablecoins into a smaller set of core primitives and precisely analyze why these primitives are thought to adjust exchange rates, what assumptions they make, and what risks they do not eliminate.

% Stablecoins are interesting to the cryptocurrency community because volatility has hampered spending, increased speculation, and hindered mature lending/credit markets from forming. %Our comparison includes pre-Bitcoin digital currencies like Liberty Reserve and e-gold, Ethereum's gas, and novel visualizations.
