This papers aims to provide an understandable survey of stablecoins---cryptocurrencies designed to have lower volatility than Bitcoin or Ether. We distil the stability mechanisms into a set of primitives and precisely analyze why they are thought to adjust exchange rates, what assumptions they are based on, and what risks still exist. Stablecoins are interesting to the cryptocurrency community because volatility has hampered transactions, increased speculation, and hindered mature lending/credit market from forming. We expand the discussion to compare to pre-Bitcoin digital currencies like Liberty Reserve and e-gold, we broaden our consideration to Ethereum's gas, and we offer some novel visualizations of exchange rates we have not seen before.

%In Table~\ref{tab:stablecoins}, we show the taxonomy we use to classify stablecoins. As mentioned earlier in Section~\ref{sec:lit}, taxonomies for stablecoins have been proposed many times. The focus of our taxonomy is a bit different; we do not care about classification \textit{per se}, we view our work as a tutorial on how to build a stablecoin and the taxonomy are simply a set of directions a designer can choose between or combine.
